			Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.

			The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8]
			In 2010, Flipkart acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service WeRead from Lulu.com.[13]

			In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[14] and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak.[15] Following the acquisition, Flipkart launched its DRM-free online music store Flyte in 2012. Due to competition from free streaming sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut down in June 2013.[16][17][18][19]

			With its eyes on India's retail market, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[20] in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for US$280 million in May 2014.[21] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[22]

			In April 2015, Flipkart acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. Flipkart stated that it would use Appiterate's technology to enhance its mobile services.[23] In December 2015, Flipkart purchased a minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia[24] and the UPI mobile payments startup PhonePe.[25][26] In 2022, when PhonePe moved its entire base to India, Flipkart separated the ownership of PhonePe and shareholders in India and Singapore and the respective shareholders purchased shares of PhonePe's India entity directly. It was announced that a cash payout of approximately $700 Mn was to be made to the former and current employees who were holding PhonePe's shares.[27][28]

			In 2016, Flipkart acquired the online fashion retailer Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for US$70 million and

			in January 2017, Flipkart made a US$2 million investment in TinyStep, a parenting information startup.[29]

			In April 2017, eBay announced that it would sell its Indian subsidiary, eBay.in, to Flipkart and invest US$500 million in the company. While eBay suggested that the partnership would allow Flipkart to access eBay's network of international vendors, these plans never came to fruition.[30][31] In July 2017, Flipkart made an offer to acquire its main domestic competitor, Snapdeal, for US$700 to 800 million. It was rejected by Snapdeal, which was seeking at least US$1 billion.[32]

			In August 2018, American retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing Flipkart at around US$20 billion.[33] Flipkart is valued at $37.6 billion as of 2022.[34] It is planning to go public through a listing in the United States of America in 2023.[35]

			Flipkart invested US$4 million in the customer engagement and rewards platform EasyRewardz on 19 November 2019.[36][37]

			In 2020, Flipkart Wholesale launched a digital platform for kiranas and MSMEs.[38] In July 2020, Flipkart acquired a 27% stake in Arvind Fashions Limited's newly formed subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands for US$35 million. Arvind Youth Brands owns the Flying Machine brand.[39] Flipkart also announced it will roll out Flipkart Quick, a hyperlocal 90-minute delivery service for product categories such as groceries, home accessories.
